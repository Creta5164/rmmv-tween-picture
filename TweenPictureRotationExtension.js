 * @help
 * This plugin is addon for TweenPicture.js that
 *  adds animate rotation feature.
 *  
 * Created by Creta Park (https://creft.me/cretapark)

 * GitHub page : https://github.com/creta5164/rmmv-tween-picture
 * Recommanded MV version : 1.6.2^
 * 
 * Limitation
 * 
 * This plugin may not be compatible with
 *  third party plugins that rotate pictures.
 * 
 * Usage
 * 
 * You must place this below TweenPicture plugin.
 * 
 * * All movements available here are applied
 *   to the Tween Picture's easing effect.
 * * All functions of this plugin do not wait for events.
 *   If you want to wait for the rotation animation to finish,
 *   specify a wait event after every rotation script event
 *   for as long as it takes.
 * 
 * Basic usage is simple, add below script event to rotate picture.
 * RotatePicture(<Picture ID>, <Degree>, <Duration frames>);
 * 
 * - Picture ID      : Picture's ID you want to rotate.
 * - Degree          : Destination degree of rotation.
 * - Duration frames : Duration of rotation move. (60 frames per second)
 *                     Set 0 to rotate immediately.
 * 
 * Note that, basic rotation is moves to closest way to target degree.
 * It never rotates over 180 degree way.
 * 
 * Example : Rotate to -45 degree to picture 1.
 *           (It'll be 315 degree.)
 * RotatePicture(1, -45, 60);
 * 
 * You can use this instead to rotate the arrival degree by its absolute value.
 * RotatePictureFixed(<Picture ID>, <Degree>, <Duration frames>);
 * 
 * - Picture ID      : Picture's ID you want to rotate.
 * - Degree          : Destination degree of rotation. (absolute)
 * - Duration frames : Duration of rotation move. (60 frames per second)
 *                     Set 0 to rotate immediately.
 * 
 * Using this will unconditionally rotate the picture
 *  from the current degree value to target degree value.
 * For example, when the picture is at 0 degrees,
 *  using 1080(360 x 3) will make it rotate 3 times.
 * 
 * Example : Rotate picture 1 by 1080 degrees for make it rotates 3 times.
 *           (Rotates 1080 degrees from the current angle of the picture)
 * 
 * RotatePicture(1, 1080, 300);
 *
